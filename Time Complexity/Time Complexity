Time Complexity of a program is the time taken for a program to run, given the input size keeps on increasing.

You can understand the need for time complexity analysis of a program by seeing the first video of TIME COMPLEXITY on "https://youtube.com/mycodeschool"

Running Time of an algorithm depends uopn :

	1. Single or multi-processor
	2. 32-bit or 64-bit processor
	3. Read/Write speed to memory
	4. Input to the computer

When we talk about time complexity, we take into account only the last option.
