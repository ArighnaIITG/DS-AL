Asymptotic Notations :

     1. Big-Oh Notation - Gives the rate of growth of running time of an algorithm with respect to 
                          the input given.

                 FORMAL DEFINITION : Let there be some non-negative function g(n).

                                     So, ""O(g(n)) = Set of all functions f(n) such that g(n) <= c*f(n)
                                         for all n>=n0, where c & n0 are constants.""
