Asymptotic Notations :

     1. Big-Oh Notation - Gives the rate of growth of running time of an algorithm with respect to 
                          the input given.

                 FORMAL DEFINITION : Let there be some non-negative function g(n).

                                     So, ""O(g(n)) = Set of all functions f(n) such that f(n) <= c*g(n)
                                         for all n>=n0, where c & n0 are constants."" 

                 One example :
                 				f(n) = 5*n**2 + 2*n + 1
                 				g(n) = n**2

                 		So, if c=8, then f(n) <= 8*n**2 for all n >= 1.
                 		So, f(n) has O(n**2) notation.

      2. Omega Notation : Gives the lower bound of rate of growth of running time of an algorithm with
      					  respect to the input given.

      			 FORMAL DEFINITION : Let there be some non-negative function g(n).

                                     So, ""omega(g(n)) = Set of all functions f(n) such that c*g(n) <= f(n)
                                         for all n>=n0, where c & n0 are constants."" 

                 One example :
                 				f(n) = 5*n**2 + 2*n + 1
                 				g(n) = n**2

                 		So, if c=5, then 5*g(n) <= f(n) for all n >= 0.
                 		So, f(n) has omega(n**2) notation.
