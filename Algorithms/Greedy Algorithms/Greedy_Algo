What are Greedy Algorithms?

"Greedy Algorithms" is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the best and most obvious benefit.

An optimization problem can be solved using Greedy if the problem has the following property: At every step, we can make a choice that looks best at the moment, and we get the optimal solution of the complete problem.
